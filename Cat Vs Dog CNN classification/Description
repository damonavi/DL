A cat vs dofg classification problem where cats are represented by  and dog are represented by 1 and images are in jpeg format. The project 
make use of deep learning CNN (Convolution Neural Networks) for preparing a model for image processing. It make use of tensorflow and keras 
libraries for it. The data used to prepare and validate the model can be found in "https://www.kaggle.com/tongpython/cat-and-dog". The 
data cant be included in the repository as it contains too many pictures along with large size of each pictures. In the project the data in 
the form of images are stored in the same directory as the IPython notebook. The model gives around 98% accuracy on training set and
84% accuracy on test set.
